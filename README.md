# Language dynamics and persuasion in real-world debates

This repo contains the code for the analyses presented in our journal article, "Debate in wild: Exploring the real-world impact of language on persuasiveness" (Paxton &amp; Dale, submitted).

## Overview

Our analyses are divided into two R markdown files:

+ `debate_in_the_wild-prep_summaries_targeted.Rmd`: This notebook prepares data for analysis, provides an overview of the data, and then runs the targeted model.
+ `debate_in_the_wild-multidimensional.Rmd`: This notebook exclusively focuses on the multidimensional analyses of language.

## Notes on running and viewing

For best viewing in a *browser*, we recommend selecting the `.md` files, rather than the similarly named `.Rmd` files.  (Analyses should be run using the `.Rmd` file of the same name.)

For those unfamiliar with R markdown, we recommend taking a look at <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RStudio's introduction to R markdown</a> before attempting to run the `.Rmd` file.  (Be sure to download <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RStudio</a> first, if you do not already have it installed on your machine.)
